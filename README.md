# iNaturalist Observations Module for Joomla!

This module embeds the recent [iNaturalist.org](https://www.inaturalist.org) observations of a specific user in your Joomla! v4/5 based website. You can optionally filter the results by taxon groups such as plants, fungi & lichens, animals, or a custom taxon (ID needed). The module uses server-side caching to reduce API calls, is fully GDPR compliant, and includes multilingual support.

## üîí Protection of cache data

To prevent search engines from indexing or accessing cached texts and images, the two files `robots.txt` and `.htaccess` will be created in the cache directory during the module installation.

### Apache web server

If the automatic setup of the .htaccess file doesn't work due to a lack of authorisations, please add the following lines manually to the .htaccess file in the cache directory:

```
# Prevents direct access to all files in the cache directory
<Files *>
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
</Files>

# Prevents the indexing and display of content by search engines
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set X-Robots-Tag "noindex, nofollow, noarchive, nosnippet"
</IfModule>
```

### nginx Webserver

nginx web server does not support .htaccess files. Please add the following rules to the central configuration file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` to protect the cache directory:
```
location /cache/mod_inaturalist_observations/ {
    # Prevents access to the cache directory
    deny all;  
    # Returns the HTTP error code 403 if the directory is tried to be accessed
    return 403;
    # Prevents search engines from indexing and displaying the content
    add_header X-Robots-Tag "noindex, nofollow, noarchive, nosnippet";
}
```
